    "## What an Exception Means\n",
    "Up to this point in the course, you have heard mention of \"Python errors.\" And you might have experienced them in your code, too. The Python terminology for a Python error is _exception_. We say that Python _raises an exception_ when something bad has happened that Python can't recover from -- division by 0, trying to convert \"monkeypickles\" into an integer, or trying to look up a value in a dictionary using a non-existent key. Raising an exception is something like _raising an objection_ when you hear something that you can't let pass -- the action stops so that the objection/exception can be voiced."

    "When Python stops the action to raise an exception, it isn't pretty. Your program terminates. And Python prints a lot of information that can be awfully cryptic. It's tempting to ignore what Python prints, especially if it seems not to make sense. On that, it comes down to judgment: you need to distinguish between what you can safely ignore, and what you really need to know if you're ever going to figure out your error. Here's how to do that."

Well, what would be \"in range?\" The only list on line 3 is *a_list* -- how big can an index be if you're working with that list? The highest legal index for that list is 3 because the list has 4 elements. Clearly, we exceeded that, so somehow, our code tried to retrieve a value using an index greater than 3."
