    "If you want to encode a message to keep it secret, one way is to substitute every letter with another letter. For example, if you decide to substitue `a` with `k`, `b` with `p`, and `c` with `m`, then the message `abc` would be encoded as `kpm`. In this problem, you will write a function that does this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a dictionary to specify how to subsitute one letter for another. For example, this dictionary describes the encoding in the example above: `{'a': 'k', 'b': 'p', 'c': 'm'}`. What if we wanted to encode the message `abcd`? The dictionary doesn't have a key for `d`, so in that case, we would just keep the `d` unchanged. The encoded message would then be `kpmd`. What about punctuation? Treat puncutation the same as you treat letters -- encode the punctuation if the dictionary contains an encoding for it, otherwise keep the character as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function named `encode` that takes two arguments, an encoding dictionary and a string. Your function should return the encoded version of the string. Do this in a case-insensitive way, that is, treat `a` and `A` as the same letter. You may assume that in the encoding dictionary, all keys are in lowercase.\n",
