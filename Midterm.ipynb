    "Imagine you put D dollars in a bank account. Periodically, the bank calculates some percentage of your balance as interest and adds that amount to your account. (This is compound interest.) For example, suppose you put $100 in the bank, and the bank pays 1% interest each period:\n",

A company collects responses to a question such as, “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend us to a friend or family member?” Anyone who answers 9 or 10 is considered a _promoter_. Anyone who answers in the range 0 to 6 (inclusive) is a _detractor_. The Net Promoter Score is then:\n",

Write a function named _nps_ that takes one argument, a list of integers that represent several responses to the question above. Based on the description above, your function should calculate the Net Promoter Score and return it as a float between -1 and 1. (In other words, don’t multiply the score by 100; if it comes out to .23, return .23, not 23.) Do not worry about rounding.\n",

    "In its _random_ module, Python has a function named _random_ that generates random numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Each number generated is a Python \"float,\" that is, a decimal fraction such as 0.24972283792638705.\n",

    "To do this, write a function named _distribution_ that takes one integer argument. It doesn't matter what you name the argument to your function, but for discussion, let's call it _x_. Your function should use _x_ as a loop counter, and what it should do _x_ times is call Python's _random_ function.  As your function loops, it must count how many random values fall into each of these 10 ranges: [0, .1), [.1, .2), [.2, .3), [.3, .4), ... [.9, 1.0). In every range, the low end is inclusive and the high end is exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your loop is finished, your function should return a list of 10 integers, one list element for each of the 10 ranges listed above. Each list element denotes how many of the random values fell into that range.\n",
