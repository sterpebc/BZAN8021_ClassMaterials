    "\n",
    "**The Special Rules**\n",
    "* Only look for _rain_ in lowercase.\n",
    "* _rain_ must be a complete word; don't be fooled by longer words that might contain the letters _rain_ in them.\n",
    "* _rain_ could be anywhere in the string, that is, the first word, the last word, or somewhere in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An Assumption You May Make**\n",
    "* The argument string will not contain any punctuation symbols, except that if it contains multiple words, there will be exactly one space between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "```\n",
    "detect('The rain in Spain')  should return True\n",
